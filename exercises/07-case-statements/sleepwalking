# Create a startup script for an application called sleepwalkingserver, which is provided below.
# The script should be named sleepwalking and accept "start" and "stop" as arguments. If
# anything other than "start" or "stop" is provided as an argument, display a usage statement:
# "Usage sleepwalking start|stop" and terminate the script with an exit status of 1.

# To start sleepwalkingserver, use this command: "/tmp/sleepwalkingserver &"
#
# To stop sleepwalkingserver, use this command: "kill $(cat /tmp/sleepwalkingserver.pid)"
