#! /bin/bash

# Write a shell script that renames all files in the current directory that end in ".jpg" to begin with
# today's date in the following format: YYYYMMDD. For example, if a picture of my cat was in
# the current directory and today was October 31, 2016 it would change name from "mycat.jpg" to "20161031mycat.jpg".
#
# Hint: Look at the format options to the date command.
#
# For "extra credit" make sure to gracefully handle instances where there are no ".jpg" files in the
# current directory. (Hint: Man bash and read the section on the nullglob option.)
